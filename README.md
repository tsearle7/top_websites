gathering text data from top million websites

The purpose of this project is to analyze the text data from the top million websites visited every day. This data is collected on University of Michigan - Ann Arbor servers, and is under research to identify trends in popular websites. Understanding these trends may allow us to make predictions for the future, and to better distinguish why certain websites are more successful than others.
